### Version
1.0.0

### Installation

Angular Crash Course requires the use of a server to run properly.  As such, first install MAMP/WAMP/XAMPP, or similar client-side server before starting. 

* If you're using a Mac, ensure you place the entire contents of the repo in the HTDOCS folder.  
* Start MAMP, open your browser of choice, then enter in the address bar:

```sh
localhost:8888/angularCrashCourse
```


* For Windows users, place the contents in the appropriate WAMP folder.
* Start WAMP, open your browser of choice, then enter in the address bar:

```sh
localhost/angularCrashCourse
```

You can also install via a hosting service (justhost, goDaddy, etc).  

### Want to Contribute?

Great!  Just make a fork and submit a pull request.  I'm sure I've made more than a few mistakes.  

### Requirements

None, just get that local server installed or else you will see nothing. NOTHING!


### Plugins

Angular Crash Course comes with the following plugins (for tutorial purposes).  

* Font Awesome 4.3
* ng-sanitize
* ui-router
* jQuery


### Development

Obviously I didn't cover EVERY aspect of Angular; just the big ones that I think Angular users of all experiences can appretiate.
